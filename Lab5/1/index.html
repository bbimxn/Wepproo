    <h1>I Want It That Way</h1>
    <p>‘I Want It That Way’ was a play with words. When Max came up with the original idea for the song, it already had
        the line ‘you are my fire, the one desire.’ We tried a million different variations on the second verse, and
        finally we had to go back to what was sounding so great, ‘you are my fire, the one desire.’ And then we changed
        it to ‘am I your fire, your one desire,’ which made absolutely no sense in combination with the chorus – but
        everybody loved it!</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 70px;">So… do you recognize this man at all? I was hiding in a bathroom stall, so I didn’t
        see his face.
        But I heard him. He was singing along to the music at the bar.
        Do you remember what he was singing?
        I think it was that song “I Want It That Way.”
        Number one, could you please sing the opening of “I Want It That Way”?
